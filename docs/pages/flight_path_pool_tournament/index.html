    <h1>Sunday Pool Tournament Rules:</h1>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Tournament Structure</h2>
        <p>The tournament is a bracket-style, double-elimination tournament. Players will be initally randomly paired
            with eachother to play in race-to-2 matches to advance, after which point winners proceed in the bracket,
            and losers join the redemption bracket.</p>
        <p>At the end of the tournament, the top player in the winners bracket will play the top player in the
            redemption bracket in a skewed final match where the player from the winner's bracket only needs 2 wins to
            finish, and the player from the redemption bracket needs 3.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Breaking</h2>
        May be decided by:
        <ul>
            <li>coin flip</li>
            <li>lag for break</li>
            <li>mutatual agreement</li>
        </ul>
        <i>Note on lagging for break: </i>
        After hitting the opposite rail, the ball which gets the closest to the
        the near rail <u>WITHOUT HITTING IT</u> wins.
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Scratching</h2>
        If during regular play, the cue ball:
        <ul>
            <li>fails to make contact with one of the shooting player's balls (ex: stripes)</li>
            <li>hits one of the opposite player's balls first (ex: solids)</li>
            <li>goes into a pocket</li>
        </ul>
        that player has scratched.
        <p>
            In addition, if no ball is pocketed, the cue ball or a ball it has contacted during the shot must touch at
            least one rail, otherwise that player has scratched.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Ball-In-Hand</h2>
        <p>If a player scratches, the other player may place the cue ball anywhere they choose before making their shot.
        </p>
        <p>The only exception to this rule is when a player has scratched on the break, in which case the other player
            plays from the kitchen.</p>
        <p>When playing from the kitchen, a player must shoot from behind the second diamond (same side as the inital
            break) and may only target balls on the far side of the second diamond.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Call-Your-Pocket</h2>
        <p>Before shooting, players must name both their target ball (the ball they intend to pocket) and
            their destination (which pocket the target ball will go in).</p>
        <p>If the player fails to pocket their target ball, play proceeds as normal to the next player.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>8-Ball Rules</h2>
        <p>In order to win, a player's final shot must be to call and pocket the 8-ball.</p>
        <p>If a player scratches on the 8-ball by pocketing the cue ball <u>AND</u> the other player still has balls on
            the table, it is treated as a regular scratch and play proceeds with the other player getting ball-in-hand.
        </p>
        <p>In any other scenario, a scratch on the 8-ball is considered a loss.</p>
