    <h1>Sunday Pool Tournament Rules:</h1>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Tournament Structure</h2>
        <p>The tournament is a bracket-style, double-elimination tournament. Players will be initally randomly paired
            with eachother to play in race-to-2 matches to advance, after which point winners proceed in the bracket,
            and losers join the redemption bracket.</p>
        <p>At the end of the bracket, the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the redemption bracket.</p>
        <p>In order to win the tournament, the winner-bracket player must win one match, whereas the redemption-bracket
            player must win two. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Breaking</h2>
        May be decided by:
        <ul>
            <li>coin flip</li>
            <li>lag for break</li>
            <li>mutatual agreement</li>
        </ul>
        <i>Note on lagging for break: </i>
        After hitting the opposite rail, the ball which gets the closest to the
        the near rail <u>WITHOUT HITTING IT</u> wins.
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Scratching</h2>
        The cue ball must make contact with the object ball, THEN a ball must make it to either a pocket or a rail
        otherwise it's considered a scratch. If the cue ball goes off the table, it's also considered a scratch.
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Ball-In-Hand</h2>
        <p>If a player scratches, the other player may place the cue ball anywhere they choose before making their shot.
        </p>
        <p>The only exception to this rule is when a player has scratched on the break, in which case the other player
            plays from the kitchen.</p>
        <p>When playing from the kitchen, a player must shoot from behind the second diamond (same side as the inital
            break) and may only target balls on the far side of the second diamond.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Call-Your-Pocket</h2>
        <p>Before shooting, players must name both their target ball (the ball they intend to pocket) and
            their destination (which pocket the target ball will go in).</p>
        <p>If the player fails to pocket their target ball, play proceeds as normal to the next player.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>8-Ball Rules</h2>
        <p>In order to win, a player's final shot must be to call and pocket the 8-ball.</p>
        <p>If a player shooting on the 8-ball pockets the cue ball <u>AND</u> the other player still has balls on
            the table, it is treated as a table-scratch and play proceeds with the other player getting ball-in-hand.
        </p>
        <p>If the 8-ball is pocketed in any pocket other than the one the shooter called, it's an automatic loss.</p>
        <p>If the 8-ball is pocked early, it's an automatic loss.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="breaking-box">
        <h2>Rule Disputes</h2>
        <p>If at any time players disagree about the rules, the tournament director will have final say. After the
            ruling, these rules will be clarified to reflect any updates.</p>
